# berlin-traffi-accident-analysis
Data analysis project exploring traffic accident patterns in Berlin (2018â€“2021) using Python, Tableau, and clustering techniques.

Absolutely! Here's a GitHub repository template based on your Berlin traffic accident project, following the same structure and tone as the Rockbuster example:

### ðŸ“Š Berlin Traffic Accident Analysis

---

### **Overview**

This project was developed as part of a data analytics course and focuses on real-world traffic accident data collected in Berlin from 2018 to 2021. The aim was to uncover spatial and temporal patterns in accident occurrence, with particular attention to vulnerable road users like cyclists and pedestrians.

As a data analyst, I was responsible for cleaning, exploring, and analyzing the dataset using Python, as well as presenting insights in an interactive Tableau storyboard tailored for stakeholders in the public sector.

### **Objectives**

The project involved:

* Cleaning and exploring accident data using pandas and visualizations in Python
* Conducting correlation and regression analyses to understand accident patterns
* Applying clustering to identify high-risk accident zones across Berlin
* Creating a Tableau storyboard with actionable recommendations for urban planners

---

### **Key Questions Addressed**

* When do most traffic accidents occur in Berlin?
* Do accidents cluster around certain times or locations?
* Is distance from the city center related to accident frequency?
* Are different types of locations (urban core vs fringe) associated with different accident patterns?
* What spatial clusters can help identify where to focus road safety efforts?

---

### **Tools Used**

* **Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)** â€“ for cleaning, exploration, and visual analysis
* **Scikit-learn** â€“ for clustering and regression
* **Tableau** â€“ for building a clear, interactive storyboard aimed at non-technical stakeholders
* **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ for documentation and reproducibility
* **Git/GitHub** â€“ for version control and portfolio presentation
